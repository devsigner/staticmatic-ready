# StaticMatic Starter!
*This is what I use when I start a new StaticMatic project.*

## Setup
This project is now using bundler and RVM gem sets. This means setup is as simple as opening the console to the project directory and adding an RVM gem set:

<pre><code>rvm gemset create 'staticmatic-starter'
bundle install</code></pre>

**Note:** If you're not using RVM, you can still install the gems with bundler using `bundle install`. RVM gem sets are great because they let you
isolate your gem libraries per project.

## Compass Configuration

Now StaticMatic automatically detects the compass configuration and loads in your settings from /config/compass.rb. I currently have my
configuration set such that <code>relative_assets = true</code> I often deploy to subdirectories on a development server to share my static prototypes.
If you are deploying to root directories, you will probably want to comment out the relative_assets line or remove it.

## Goodies
- <code>rake build</code> builds the site
- <code>rake watch</code> watches your project directory and automatically recompiles the site as you change files
- <code>rake push</code> deploys the site (via rsync) to your remote server (based on your configurations in the rakefile)
- <code>rake deploy</code> runs build and then push


That's about it, pretty simple really.
